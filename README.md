# CoreGraphicsInstagramArtwork README #

## Description ##
*Draws the Instagram iTunes Artwork using only CoreGraphics.*

A while back Instagram had on their jobs webpage for applicants the extra bonus "single drawRect function for a single 400x400 UIView that does something magical", I liked the challenge and decided to approximate the Instagram logo itself.

It features ~700 LOC CoreGraphics drawing code, including a quick implementation of multiplicative monochrome normal distributed saturated noise, usage of blending modes, shadows, gradients, smoothing radial gradients through clipping, and bezier paths with arcs for reflections.

Back then I had fun doing it and now found this dusty piece of code, cleaned it up a bit and like to share it.
